Learning the lowdown on Lutris

Learning Linux as well

Windows 11 on brand new Gaming PC horribly hacked

Learning to literally hate Windows... Did I say hate? I should change that to hack...

Total noob on the Linux tube but already loving it!

Like, what took me so long? Anyways...

Looking for the coolest coders to catch me up to speed
